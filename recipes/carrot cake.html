    <h3><font size="+3">What is Carrot cake?</font></h3>
    <p>Carrot cake is cake that contains carrots mixed into the batter.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Sugars: You'll need white sugar for the cake and confectioners' sugar for the frosting.</li>
            <li>Oil: A neutral oil, such as vegetable oil, adds moisture without imparting flavor.</li>
            <li>Eggs: Four whole eggs lend moisture and help bind the carrot cake batter together.</li>
            <li>Vanilla: Two teaspoons of vanilla extract for the cake (and one teaspoon for the frosting) enhances the flavor.</li>
            <li>lour: All-purpose flour creates structure and brings the batter together.</li>
            <li>Leaveners: Baking soda and baking powder act as leaveners, which means they help the cake rise.</li>
            <li>Cinnamon: Ground cinnamon adds that warm, cozy flavor you associate with carrot cake.</li>
            <li>Salt: Salt enhances the flavors of the other ingredients, but it won't make the cake taste salty.</li>
            <li>Carrots: Of course, you'll need grated carrots!</li>
            <li>Pecans: Chopped pecans give the cake and frosting a pleasant crunch.</li>
            <li>Butter and cream cheese: Butter and cream cheese are the key ingredients in the light and fluffy cream cheese frosting.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>How to Make Carrot Cake Step-By-Step</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Make the batter: Beat the wet ingredients together, then mix in the dry ingredients. Stir in the carrots and fold in the pecans.</li>
            <li>Bake the cake: Pour the batter into the prepared cake pan or pans. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick comes out clean.</li>
            <li>Frost the cake: Beat the frosting ingredients together until smooth and creamy. Stir in the pecans. Frost the (completely cooled) cake.</li>
        </ol>
